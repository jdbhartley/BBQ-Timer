    • Class: incorporate at least 2 classes in the program – Line 3 and 43
    • Objects and methods: create objects, constructor and use methods to access these objects. - Lines  7, 12, 16, 29, 50-56
    • Arrays: include an array, 1 or more dimension is acceptable. - Line 59
    • Control access to class members – Lines 4, 5
    • Include packages to streamline development. - Line 1
    • Implement interfaces: at least more than one interface in the program. - Line 46
